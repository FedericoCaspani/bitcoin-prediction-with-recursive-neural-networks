# Bitcoin Prediction with Neural Networks

NUMERICAL ANALYSIS FOR MACHINE LEARNING - Project (A.Y. 2021)

This repository is the implementation of the project for the Numerical Analysis for Machine Learning course.
The project consists in creating a small recurrent neural network for forcasting the price of a cryptocurrency through time.
For better explanation refers to the [report](/deliveries/NAML-Report.pdf) for our work.
